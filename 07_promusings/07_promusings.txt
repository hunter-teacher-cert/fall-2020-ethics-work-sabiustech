Final Ethics Projects


The following represent a list of potential topics of research for the final project for this course. I will be working with a partner on this project. The priority of interest is descending. 


NYCDOE School Selection Algorithm
Preferences and Outcomes: A Look at New York City’s Public High School Choice Process

How Game Theory Helped Improve New York City High SChool Application Process
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/nyregion/how-game-theory-helped-improve-new-york-city-high-school-application-process.html
Coding component: creating the matching algorithm and showing how the inputs are the problem, not the algorithm itself




Algorithmic Bias in AI and ML
Algorithmic Bias Detection and Mitigation Best Practice and Policies to Reduce Consumer Harms

Bias in Algorithms
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-are-algorithms-biased-8449406aaa83
Coding component: Creating an AI “bot” that only produces decisions based on the data provided to show how the bias is replicated. 


Gamifying education: what is known, what is believed and what remains uncertain: a critical review

Five Ways to Gamify your Classroom
https://www.iste.org/explore/In-the-classroom/5-ways-to-gamify-your-classroom
Coding Component: Create a program that will provide ideas on how to gamify a classroom based on a subject (using an API) and determining (based on selections) the percentage of increase in engagement potential by making these changes.
